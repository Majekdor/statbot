# Statbot

Statbot is a Discord bot built using Discord.js currently in development by Majekdor. It is primarily used in a private Discord server for 
viewing Rocket League ranks and stats.

If you want to use Statbot you'll have to clone this repo, add the necessary values to the `demoConfig.json`, and rename 
that file to `config.json`. Eventually there will be a link and you can just invite the bot to your server, but that 
won't be released until early development is finished.
